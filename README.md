# Topic4 Task2
Creation of Linked Data version of administrative public dataset

Source data taken from: https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/

Requirements
▪ Implement and release a Linked Data version of a popular/basic registry.
▪ Establish links between spatial objects (from BAG and/or the Farmland data in task 1) and non-spatial data from the registry.
▪ Discuss approaches for establishing, maintaining, representing links in such a set-up with obstacles and/or benefits from both the point of view of providers (of the spatial as well as the non-spatial data) and users.
▪ The different approaches should be documented with worked examples and may require extensions to the ‘crawlifier’ proxy from task 1.
▪ Investigate what is required to make linking spatial data usable and programmable for web-developers and non-expert users.
▪ Identify requirements so that linked properties are retained after user downloads the data (include provenance information, link to metadata, covered by the metadata requirement from above).

o Documentation of findings with worked examples
